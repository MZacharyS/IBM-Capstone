This project will leverage the data found through Foursquare, as well as Wikipedia. A list of neighborhoods and their postal codes will be scrapped from wikipedia, and then the latitude and longitude of those locations will be found using geocoder. Analysis will be done using k-means clustering, and a final result and conclusion delivered. "
